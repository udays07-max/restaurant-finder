        <h1><b>About Wai City</b></h1>
        <h5>Wai is a town in Satara district of Maharashtra state in India. Located on the Krishna River, Wai was a prominent town during the Peshwa era. Two important Marathi Brahmin from ruling families had their origins here: Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi (Tambe family) and Gopikabai, wife of Nanasaheb Peshwa (Raste family).
           Locally prominent families such as the Raste, Ranade, and Phadnavis built several architecturally significant temples in Wai. The 400-year-old Mandhradevi Kalubai temple is about 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) from Wai on a hill 718 metres (2,356 ft) above sea level.[2] In recent decades, Wai has become a popular location for filming Bollywood and Marathi movies, with over 300 films having been shot in and near Wai.</h5>
        
        <h2><b>History</b></h2>
        <h5>Wai has the epithetic name "Dakshin Kashi" (Kashi or Varanasi of the South) because of the city's more than 100 temples. Wai is known in Maharashtra for its ghats on the banks of the Krishna River and its temples, especially the Dholya ganapati temple on Ganapati Ghat.
           The 17th-century warlord Afzal Khan, representing Ali Adil Shah II of the Bijapur Sultanate, is said to have made his first halt here on his way to the fort Pratapgad of the Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.
